EPM 4.4 is a maintenance release that fixes RPM packaging and several build
issues.

<!--more-->
Changes include:

- The default prefix is now the usual `/usr/local` (Issue #45)
- Really fix 64-bit Intel packages on Debian-based OS's (Issue #48)
- Fixed a build issue on Solaris 11 (Issue #50)
- Fixed a bug in temporary file cleanup when symlinks are used (Issue #51)
- Added DESTDIR support to makefiles (Issue #55)
- Fixed RPM support on AIX (Issue #56)
- Reverted the hard links optimization from EPM 4.2 since it is causing
  problems with the latest version of RPM (Issue #57)
- Packages on macOS now use "macos" as the operating system name for
  consistency.

Enjoy!
