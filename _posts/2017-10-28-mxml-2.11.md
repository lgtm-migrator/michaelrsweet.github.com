Changes include:

- CDATA nodes now omit the trailing "]]" for convenience (Issue #170)
- Fixed a memory leak in mxmlDelete (Issue #183)
- `mxmlElementSetAttrf` did not work with some versions of Visual Studio
  (Issue #184)
- Added `mxmlElementGetAttrByIndex` and `mxmlELementGetAttrCount` functions
  (Issue #185)
- The configure script now properly supports cross-compilation (Issue #188)
- The mxmldoc utility now supports generation of EPUB files (Issue #189)
- The mxmldoc utility now supports the `SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH` environment
  variable for reproducible builds (Issue #193)
- The mxmldoc utility now supports Markdown (Issue #194)
- Fixed writing of custom data values (Issue #201)
- Added `mxmlNewOpaquef` and `mxmlSetOpaquef` functions to add and set formatted
  opaque string values.
- The mxmldoc utility scanned and loaded descriptive text differently, causing
  the detailed descriptions ("discussion") to be lost in generated
  documentation.
- The mxmldoc utility now supports `@exclude format@` comments to exclude
  documentation based on the output format.  The format string can be `all` to
  exclude documentation for all formats or a comma-delimited list such as
  `@exclude man,html@`.
