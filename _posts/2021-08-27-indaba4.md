I had the privilege of being a guest with Till Kamppeter on this month's [Ubuntu Desktop Team Indaba](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P22DOu_ahBo) to talk about open source printing - the early history, where we are today, and where we are headed. Be sure to check out the video and the [OpenPrinting](https://openprinting.github.io) web sites for more information and links to all of the projects that are being worked on.
