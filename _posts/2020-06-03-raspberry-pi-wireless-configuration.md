Over the past few weeks I have been working with
[Yocto](https://www.yoctoproject.org), specifically to put together a layer
containing [PAPPL](https://www.msweet.org/pappl) and other necessary bits to
build headless Raspberry Pi-based print servers.  And since I'm a standards guy
I want this setup to more-or-less pass all of the certification tests.
Unfortunately, this has taken a bit longer than I'd hoped...

Yocto
-----

Yocto is an embedded Linux development environment - basically you create
custom Linux images for the Raspberry Pi (or whatever other embedded board you
are using), download them to the board or an SD card, and then run it.  You can
also develop in QEMU virtual machines, although I haven't actually bothered with
that.

Yocto is organized into "images" which are the final OS images you put on your
board, "layers" which are logical pieces of the OS - core, networking, multimedia,
Board Support Packages ("BSPs"), etc. -  and "recipes" which represent
individual packages or components for the OS.  You can customize all of these
things, and everything gets compiled from source code or (if you are very lucky)
can be found in an official pre-compiled repository hosted by the Yocto project.
Building a Yocto image for the first time takes several hours, even on a really
fast machine...

I've been working with the "Zeus" branch (which until recently was the newest)
and the official "meta-raspberrypi" BSP layer.  To that I've updated the
[Avahi](https://www.avahi.org), [CUPS](https://www.cups.org),
and [dhcpcd](https://roy.marples.name/projects/dhcpcd/) "recipes" to pull in the
current versions of each.


Certification Tests
-------------------

The two public certification tests I've been focusing on have been the PWG's
[IPP Everywhereâ„¢ Printer Self-Certification Tools](https://www.pwg.org/ippeveselfcert)
and Apple's [Bonjour Conformance Test ("BCT")](https://developer.apple.com/bonjour).
PAPPL easily passes the IPP Everywhere tests, but getting the BCT to pass has
been a major challenge thanks to some interesting bugs in the wireless
drivers/firmware used for the Raspberry Pi.


Raspberry Pi Wireless Drivers
-----------------------------

The Wi-Fi chipset used in Raspberry Pi boards is USB-based and is a "FullMAC"
implementation - the chipset handles all of the low-level Wi-Fi communications,
power management, reading/writing of packets, etc. and just passes on the
(processed) information to the kernel driver.  So this means the Wi-Fi chip
firmware needs to know how to handle low-level IP details and whether a given
IP packet that is received over Wi-Fi needs to be passed on to the kernel.  This
is where the problems begin.

The first part of the BCT is a test of IPv4 link-local address handling.  With
IPv4, link-local addresses (169.254.0.0/16) are typically only used when you
don't have any working Internet infrastructure (more specifically, when there
isn't a working DHCP server).  Each network device will try a series of
semi-random addresses when it first comes on the network to find an available
address.  The underlying protocol is defined in
[RFC 3927](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3927) and uses Address Resolution
Protocol ("ARP") packets - a device asks whether any other device on the network
is using a particular IP address, and if nothing answers after three attempts it
then claims the address by announcing it a few times.

This query process is where things break with the default wireless settings and
the Raspberry Pi wireless firmware.  ARP packets are not addressed to a
particular network device and they really need to be passed on to the kernel
for processing.  The current firmware for the Raspberry Pi Wi-Fi chipset does
not do this, however, preventing the link-local queries from working.  In
addition, the power saving mode puts the Wi-Fi chipset to sleep in the middle of
the BCT tests which run for several hours!


Getting BCT to Pass
-------------------

After much research and experimentation, I ended up writing a small script to
disable power management and put the Wi-Fi interface in "promiscuous" mode so
that the Wi-Fi firmware sends all packets to the kernel and not just the ones
with its local addresses:

```
"set-wireless-options.sh"

#!/bin/sh
iw dev wlan0 set power_save off
ifconfig wlan0 promisc
```

I call this script from the `/etc/network/interfaces` configuration file:

```
"/etc/network/interfaces" (snippet)

# Wireless interface
auto wlan0
iface wlan0 inet dhcp
    wireless_mode managed
    wireless_essid any
    wpa-driver nl80211
    wpa-conf /etc/wpa_supplicant.conf
    # Replace "/PATH/TO" with the actual path to the script...
    pre-up /PATH/TO/set-wireless-options.sh
```

With those changes I can get a Raspberry Pi Zero W to pass BCT.


Future Developments
-------------------

At some point I will be making my Yocto layer public on Github, complete with
the necessary recipes for PAPPL and other key components needed for a headless
print server.  I'm also hoping that I'll be able to get some firmware and/or
kernel driver bug fixes to make it unnecessary to use promiscuous mode or turn
the power-saver features off - we'll see...
