So today was my last day at Apple. Apple has been a great company to work for and I'm grateful for my time there. I accomplished most of the things I'd hoped for, particularly getting solid Internet Printing Protocol support in almost all network and USB printers sold over the last 10 years. I chaired the Printer Working Group for about half of my time at Apple, met and worked with a lot of really talented and considerate people, and mentored a few young engineers that have either excelled within Apple or moved on to their next challenges.

Going forward I'll be taking a little time to reboot and start a new company with my amazing wife. I've missed working with her every day these last 13 years and I'm really excited to see where our new journey will take us.
