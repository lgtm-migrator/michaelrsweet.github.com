The OpenPrinting group of the Linux Foundation had a session at the 2021
(virtual) Linux Plumber's Conference yesterday. I led a discussion about the
upcoming CUPS 2.4 release, next year's planned CUPS 2.5 release, and 2023's
planned CUPS 3.0 release which will (finally) eliminate printer drivers on
Linux. Till presented developments in printer management and packaging on Linux,
print dialogs, and printer applications. And Bhavna talked about her Google
Summer of Code work to extend PAPPL with scanning support.
