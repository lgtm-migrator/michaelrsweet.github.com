EPM v4.5 is a bug fix release and also removes support for some old platforms
that I can no longer support.  Changes include:

- Dropped support for AIX, AT&T (Solaris), Tru64, HP-UX, IRIX, LSB, and
  Slackware packages.
- "make install" failed due to the README filename changing (Issue #59)
- The `mkepmlist` utility did not correctly handle filenames containing the
  `$` character (Issue #62)
- The configure script incorrectly substituted "NONE" for the installation
  prefix (Issue #67)
- Fixed some over-zealous permissions on temporary build directories (Issue #71)
- Fixed the mantohtml helper program - was depending on private CUPS headers for
  some reason (Issue #72)
- Fixed some build system issues (Issue #75, Issue #76)
- Documentation updates (Issue #74, Issue #77)
- Cleaned up old sprintf and strcpy usage in many places.

Enjoy!
