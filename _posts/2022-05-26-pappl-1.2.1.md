PAPPL v1.2.1 is now available for download and fixes some key issues with
localization, client limits, and compiling against older versions of CUPS.
Changes in 1.2.1 include:

- Fixed a bug in the max-clients support code (Issue #205)
- Fixed compiler warnings (Issue #206, Issue #207)
- Fixed corruption in the English localization file.
- PAPPL didn't compile against CUPS 2.2.6 and earlier.

Enjoy!
