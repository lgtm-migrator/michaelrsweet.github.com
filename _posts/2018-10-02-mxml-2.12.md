Changes include:

- Added yet more documentation about using `MXML_OPAQUE_CALLBACK` when you want
  to get full strings for inline text instead of separated words (Issue #190)

  them (Issue #198)
- Updated the `va_copy` macro for use with BCC (Issue #211)
- The `mxmlNewCDATA` and `mxmlSetCDATA` functions incorrectly added the XML
  trailer "]]" to the string (Issue #216)

- Fixed a crash bug in the `mxmlWrite` functions (Issue #228)
