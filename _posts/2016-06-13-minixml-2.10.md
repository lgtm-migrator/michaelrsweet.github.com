- The mxml.spec file was out of date (Bug #521)
- Mini-XML no longer allows malformed element names (Bug #509)
- mxmlLoad* and mxmlSAXLoad* did not properly create text nodes when MXML_TEXT_CALLBACK was specified (Bug #531)
- mxmlDelete used a recursive algorithm which could require large amounts of stack space depending on the file (Bug #549, CVE-2016-4570)
- mxmlWrite* used a recursive algorithm which could require large amounts of stack space depending on the file (Bug #549, CVE-2016-4571)
