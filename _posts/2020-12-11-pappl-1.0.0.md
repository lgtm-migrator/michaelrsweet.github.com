Changes in 1.0.0 include:

- `papplSystemLoadState` would not load printers whose device IDs contained the
  `#` character (Issue #92)
- Passing "auto" for the driver name would cause a crash if there was no auto-
  add callback.
- Added `papplPrinterGetPath` API to get the path for a printer web page
  (Issue #97)
- The `papplPrinterAddLink` and `papplSystemAddLink` functions now accept an
  "options" argument instead of the "secure" boolean in order to allow links to
  be added to multiple places on the web interface in addition to requesting a
  secure (HTTPS) link (Issue #98)

Enjoy!
