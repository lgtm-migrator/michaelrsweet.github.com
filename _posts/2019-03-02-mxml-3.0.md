Mini-XML 3.0 is a major release that changes the license to Apache 2.0 with
exceptions for linking to GPL2-only code, hides the definition of the internal
`mxml_node_t` structure, removes the "mxmldoc" utility (which is now maintained
in the separate "codedoc" project), and fixes several bugs.

Enjoy!

Changes include:

- Changed the license to Apache 2.0 with exceptions (Issue #239)
- All of the internal node structures are now moved out of the public header
  (Issue #240)
- Fixed a potential buffer overflow when writing floating point data
  (Issue #233)
- Moved `mxmldoc` to a new `codedoc` project whose focus is on generating
  code documentation (Issue #235, Issue #236, Issue #237)
- Error messages now include the line number of the error (Issue #230)
- The `mxmlSetCDATA`, `mxmlSetElement`, `mxmlSetOpaque`, `mxmlSetOpaquef`,
  `mxmlSetText`, and `mxmlSetTextf` functions caused a use-after-free bug if
  the value came from the same node (Issue #241)
- The `mxmlSetOpaquef` and `mxmlSetTextf` functions did not work (Issue #244)
- The `_mxml_strdupf` function did not work on Windows (Issue #245)
