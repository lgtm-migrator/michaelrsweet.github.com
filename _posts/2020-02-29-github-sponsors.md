Over the years, many people have asked whether they can financially support the
development of LPrint, HTMLDOC, and other projects I make available freely on
Github.  Until recently there hasn't been a simple way for me to do this, but
Github now has a "sponsors" program that allows you to provide monthly donations
to developers and projects, and will even match your donations for the first
year!

I've created a [Github sponsor profile](https://github.com/sponsors/michaelrsweet)
to allow you to contribute financially to any of my open source projects and
help set the direction and priority of future bug fixes, features, and supported
hardware.  Thank you for any assistance you choose to provide, whether it is
financial or in the form of a bug report, pull request, or other feedback that
helps make my software better!
