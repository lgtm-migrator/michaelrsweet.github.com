The first stable release of PDFio is now available!  PDFio is a simple C library
for reading and writing PDF files.  The primary goals of PDFio are:

- Read and write any version of PDF file
- Provide access to pages, objects, and streams within a PDF file
- Support reading and writing of encrypted PDF files
- Extract or embed useful metadata (author, creator, page information, etc.)
- "Filter" PDF files, for example to extract a range of pages or to embed fonts
  that are missing from a PDF
- Provide access to objects used for each page

PDFio is *not* concerned with rendering or viewing a PDF file, although a PDF
RIP or viewer could be written using it.

Enjoy!
