EPM is a simple cross-platform tool that generates software and patch
distributions in various formats from a list of files.  Supported formats
include:

- AIX software packages ("installp")
- AT&T software packages ("pkgadd"), used by Solaris and others
- BSD packages ("pkg_create")
- Compaq Tru64 UNIX ("setld")
- Debian Package Manager ("dpkg")
- HP-UX software packages ("swinstall")
- IRIX software manager ("inst", "swmgr", or "tardist")
- macOS software packages ("name.pkg")
- Portable (installation and removal scripts with tar files)
- Red Hat Package Manager ("rpm")
- Slackware software packages ("name.tgz")

EPM also includes graphical "setup" and "uninstall" programs that can be
provided with your distributions to make installation and removal of more than
one package a snap.  The installers can be customized with product logos,
"readme" files, and click-wrap licenses as desired.

EPM is provided as free software under version 2 of the GNU General Public
license.
