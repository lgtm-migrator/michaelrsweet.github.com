EPM is an open source UNIX software and file packaging program that generates
distribution archives from a list of files.  EPM provides a complete, cross-
platform software distribution solution for applications.  EPM generates both
native and "portable" script-based distribution packages complete with
installation and removal scripts and standard install/uninstall GUIs.  The
installers can be customized with product logos, "readme" files, and click-wrap
licenses as desired.

EPM is provided as free software under version 2 of the GNU General Public
license.
