moauthd
-------

`moauthd` is the OAuth 2.0 authentication/resource server program.  When run with no
arguments, it binds to port 9nnn where 'nnn' is the bottom three digits of your user ID
and is accessible on all addresses associated with your system's hostname.  Log messages
are written to the standard error file by default.

The `-v` option increases the verbosity of the logging, with multiple v's making the
logging progressively more verbose.  (Currently there are three levels of verbosity, so
anything past `-vv` is silently ignored...)

The `-c` option specifies a plain text configuration file that consists of blank, comment,
or "directive" lines, for example:

```
# This is a comment
ServerName oauth.example.com:9443

# This is another comment
LogLevel debug
LogFile /var/log/moauthd.log
```

The following directives are currently recognized:

- `LogFile`: Specifies the file for log messages.  The filename can be "stderr" to send
  messages to the standard error file, "syslog" to send messages to the syslog daemon,
  or "none" to disable logging.
- `LogLevel`: Specifies the logging level - "error", "info", or "debug".  The default
  level is "error" so that only errors are logged.
- `ServerName`: Specifies the host name and (optionally) port number to bind to, separated
  by a colon.  For example, "oauth.example.com:9443" specifies a host name of
  "oauth.example.com" and a port number of 9443.  The default host name is the configured
  host name of the system.  The default port number is 9nnn where 'nnn' is the bottom
  three digits of your user UI.

The log level specified in the configuration file is also affected by the `-v` option, so
if the configuration file specifies `LogLevel info` but you run `moauthd` with:

    moauthd -c /path/to/config/file -v
    
then the log level will actually be set to "debug".
