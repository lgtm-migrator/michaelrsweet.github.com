Codedoc is a general-purpose utility which scans HTML, markdown, C, and C++
source files to produce EPUB, HTML, and man page documentation that can be read
by humans.  Unlike popular C/C++ documentation generators like Doxygen or
Javadoc, Codedoc uses in-line comments rather than comment headers, allowing for
more "natural" code documentation.  Additional markdown documentation content
can be included to make the generated documentation even more useful and
complete.

Codedoc was originally bundled with the Mini-XML library as the `mxmldoc`
utility.

Codedoc is licensed under the Apache License Version 2.0.  Please do provide
feedback and report bugs to the Github project page so that everyone can
benefit.
