Codedoc is a documentation generator that scans the specified C and C++ source
files to produce an XML representation of globally accessible classes,
constants, enumerations, functions, structures, typedefs, unions, and
variables - the XML file is updated as necessary.

By default, a HTML representation of the XML file is written to the standard
output.  Codedoc also supports generating man pages and EPUB books.

Codedoc is licensed under the Apache License Version 2.0.  Please do provide
feedback and report bugs to the Github project page so that everyone can
benefit.
