      <p class="justify">HTMLDOC is a program that reads HTML source files or web pages and generates corresponding HTML, PostScript, or PDF files with an optional table of contents. HTMLDOC is provided under the terms of version 2 of the GNU General Public License.</p>
      <p class="justify">HTMLDOC was developed in the 1990's as a documentation generator for my previous company, and has since seen a lot of usage as a report generator embedded in web servers.  However, it does not support many things in "the modern web", such as:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS): While I have experimented with adding CSS support to HTMLDOC, proper CSS support is non-trivial especially for paged output (which is not well supported by CSS)</li>
        <li>Encryption: HTMLDOC currently supports the older (and very insecure) PDF 1.4 (128-bit RC4) encryption.  I have looked at supporting AES (256-bit)   encryption...</li>
        <li>Forms: HTML forms and PDF forms are very different things.  While I have had many requests to add support for PDF forms over the years, I have not found a satisfactory way to do so.</li>
        <li>Tables: HTMLDOC supports HTML 3.2 tables, which means no support for TBODY, THEAD, or TFOOT.  I have looked at supporting THEAD and TBODY...</li>
        <li>Unicode: While HTMLDOC does support UTF-8 for "Western" languages, there is absolutely no support for languages that require dynamic rewriting or right-to-left text formatting.  Basically this means you can't use HTMLDOC to format Arabic, Chinese, Hebrew, Japanese, or other languages that are not based on latin-based alphabets that read left-to-right.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="justify">HTMLDOC is no longer in active development but <em>is</em> being maintained to address security, build, and formatting issues, and to occasionally add the odd (simple) feature.</p>
