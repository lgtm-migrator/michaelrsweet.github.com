      <p class="justify">This site is the combined home of various projects created or maintained by me, Michael R Sweet. I am probably best known as the creator of <a href="https://openprinting.github.io/cups/">CUPS</a>, the de-facto standard printing system for Linux®, macOS®, and UNIX®. I have written several books and started, contributed to, and developed a lot of open source projects over the years. I was also involved in the creation of the <a href="https://www.pwg.org/ipp/index.html">Internet Printing Protocol</a>, <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201311">AirPrint&trade;</a>, <a href="https://www.pwg.org/ipp/everywhere.html">IPP Everywhere&trade;</a>, <a href="https://www.pwg.org/3d/index.html">IPP 3D</a>, IPP-USB, Wi-Fi Direct Print Services, and many other printing standards.</p>
      <p class="justify">I currently run a business with my wife called <a href="https://lakesiderobotics.ca/">Lakeside Robotics</a> developing AI for games and educational robotics products such as LEGO Mindstorms®, LEGO SPIKE Prime™, and VEX Robotics, am working on some semi-related 3D printing software, and am consulting for a few companies to help them with their printing solutions. I am also the secretary of the <a href="https://www.pwg.org/ipp/">PWG Internet Printing Protocol</a> workgroup and one of two IETF designated experts for printing.</p>
      <p class="justify">Prior to Lakeside Robotics I worked for <a href="https://www.apple.com/">Apple Inc.</a> for almost 13 years developing printing software and standards on their behalf and serving as the PWG Chair for about half of that time. Apple was a great company to work for and I'm grateful for my time there.</p>
      <p class="justify">Prior to Apple, my wife and I ran a company called Easy Software Products (ESP) which did work for various companies doing 2D and 3D graphics displays, printing software (including CUPS), server software, multi-channel audio processing, real-time data acquisition, AI simulations, natural language interfaces, and shared memory databases.</p>
      <p class="justify">When I am not writing software, standards, or books, I spend time with my wife, son, and extended family, and take lots of photos, an addiction I learned from my father on the many family camping trips we'd take. Ah, slideshows!</p>
