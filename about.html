      <p class="justify">This site is the combined home of various projects created or maintained by me, Michael R Sweet. I currently work for <a href="http://www.apple.com">Apple Inc.</a> and am probably best known as the creator of <a href="http://www.cups.org/">CUPS</a>, the de-facto standard printing system for Linux<sup>&reg;</sup>, macOS<sup>&reg;</sup>, and UNIX<sup>&reg;</sup>. I am also the secretary of the <a href="http://www.pwg.org/ipp/">Internet Printing Protocol</a> workgroup, author of many printing standards, and one of two IETF designated experts for printing.</p>
      <p class="justify">I previously ran Easy Software Products with my wife Tammy and worked for various companies doing 2D and 3D graphics displays, printing software, server software, multi-channel audio processing, real-time data acquisition, AI simulations, natural language interfaces, and shared memory databases. I have written several books and started, contributed to, and developed a lot of open source projects over the years.</p>
      <p class="justify">When I am not writing software, standards, or books, I spend time with my wife, son, and extended family, and take lots of photos, an addiction I learned from my father on the many family camping trips we'd take. Ah, slideshows!</p>
