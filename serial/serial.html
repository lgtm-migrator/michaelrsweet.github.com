<P>The Serial Programming Guide for POSIX Operating Systems will teach
 you how to successfully, efficiently, and portably program the serial
 ports on your UNIX&reg; workstation or PC. Each chapter provides
 programming examples that use the POSIX (Portable Standard for UNIX)
 terminal control functions and should work with very few modifications
 under IRIX&reg;, HP-UX, SunOS&reg;, Solaris&reg;, Digital UNIX&reg;, Linux&reg;, and most
 other UNIX operating systems. The biggest difference between operating
 systems that you will find is the filenames used for serial port device
 and lock files.</P>

<H1 ALIGN="RIGHT"><A NAME="basics">Chapter 1, Basics of Serial
 Communications</A></H1>
<P>This chapter introduces serial communications, RS-232 and other
 standards that are used on most computers as well as how to access a
 serial port from a C program.</P>
<H2><A NAME="2_1">What Are Serial Communications?</A></H2>
<P>Computers transfer information (data) one or more bits at a time.
 Serial refers to the transfer of data one bit at a time. Serial
 communications include most network devices, keyboards, mice, MODEMs,
 and terminals.</P>
<P>When doing serial communications each word (i.e. byte or character)
 of data you send or receive is sent one bit at a time. Each bit is
 either<I> on</I> or<I> off.</I> The terms you'll hear sometimes are<I>
 mark</I> for the<I> on</I> state and<I> space</I> for the<I> off</I>
 state.</P>
<P>The speed of the serial data is most often expressed as
 bits-per-second (&quot;bps&quot;) or baudot rate (&quot;baud&quot;). This just represents
 the number of ones and zeroes that can be sent in one second. Back at
 the dawn of the computer age, 300 baud was considered fast, but today
 computers can handle RS-232 speeds as high as 430,800 baud! When the
 baud rate exceeds 1,000, you'll usually see the rate shown in<I> kilo</I>
baud, or kbps (e.g. 9.6k, 19.2k, etc). For rates above 1,000,000 that
 rate is shown in<I> mega</I>baud, or Mbps (e.g. 1.5Mbps).</P>
<P>When referring to serial devices or ports, they are either labeled as<I>
 Data Communications Equipment</I> (&quot;DCE&quot;) or<I> Data Terminal Equipment</I>
 (&quot;DTE&quot;). The difference between these is simple - every signal pair,
 like transmit and receive, is swapped. When connecting two DTE or two
 DCE interfaces together, a serial<I> null-MODEM</I> cable or adapter is
 used that swaps the signal pairs.</P>
<H2><A NAME="2_2">What Is RS-232?</A></H2>
<P>RS-232 is a standard electrical interface for serial communications
 defined by the <A HREF="http://www.eia.org">Electronic Industries
 Association (&quot;EIA&quot;)</A>. RS-232 actually comes in 3 different flavors
 (A, B, and C) with each one defining a different voltage range for the<I>
 on</I> and<I> off</I> levels. The most commonly used variety is
 RS-232C, which defines a mark (on) bit as a voltage between -3V and
 -12V and a space (off) bit as a voltage between +3V and +12V. The
 RS-232C specification says these signals can go about 25 feet (8m)
 before they become unusable. You can usually send signals a bit farther
 than this as long as the baud is low enough.</P>
<P>Besides wires for incoming and outgoing data, there are others that
 provide timing, status, and handshaking:

</CENTER>
</P>
<P>Two standards for serial interfaces you may also see are RS-422 and
 RS-574. RS-422 uses lower voltages and<I> differential</I> signals to
 allow cable lengths up to about 1000ft (300m). RS-574 defines the 9-pin
 PC serial connector and voltages.</P>
<H3><A NAME="2_2_1">Signal Definitions</A></H3>
<P>The RS-232 standard defines some 18 different signals for serial
 communications. Of these, only six are generally available in the UNIX
 environment.</P>
<H4>GND - Logic Ground</H4>
<P>Technically the logic ground is not a signal, but without it none of
 the other signals will operate. Basically, the logic ground acts as a
 reference voltage so that the electronics know which voltages are
 positive or negative.</P>
<H4>TXD - Transmitted Data</H4>
<P>The TXD signal carries data transmitted from your workstation to the
 computer or device on the other end (like a MODEM). A mark voltage is
 interpreted as a value of 1, while a space voltage is interpreted as a
 value of 0.</P>
<H4>RXD - Received Data</H4>
<P>The RXD signal carries data transmitted from the computer or device
 on the other end to your workstation. Like TXD, mark and space voltages
 are interpreted as 1 and 0, respectively.</P>
<H4>DCD - Data Carrier Detect</H4>
<P>The DCD signal is received from the computer or device on the other
 end of your serial cable. A space voltage on this signal line indicates
 that the computer or device is currently connected or on line. DCD is
 not always used or available.</P>
<H4>DTR - Data Terminal Ready</H4>
<P>The DTR signal is generated by your workstation and tells the
 computer or device on the other end that you are ready (a space
 voltage) or not-ready (a mark voltage). DTR is usually enabled
 automatically whenever you open the serial interface on the
 workstation.</P>
<H4>CTS - Clear To Send</H4>
<P>The CTS signal is received from the other end of the serial cable. A
 space voltage indicates that it is alright to send more serial data
 from your workstation.</P>
<P>CTS is usually used to regulate the flow of serial data from your
 workstation to the other end.</P>
<H4>RTS - Request To Send</H4>
<P>The RTS signal is set to the<I> space</I> voltage by your workstation
 to indicate that more data is ready to be sent.</P>
<P>Like CTS, RTS helps to regulate the flow of data between your
 workstation and the computer or device on the other end of the serial
 cable. Most workstations leave this signal set to the space voltage all
 the time.</P>
<H2><A NAME="2_3">Asynchronous Communications</A></H2>
<P>For the computer to understand the serial data coming into it, it
 needs some way to determine where one character ends and the next
 begins. This guide deals exclusively with<I> asynchronous</I> serial
 data.</P>
<P>In asynchronous mode the serial data line stays in the mark (1) state
 until a character is transmitted. A<I> start</I> bit preceeds each
 character and is followed immediately by each bit in the character, an
 optional parity bit, and one or more<I> stop</I> bits. The start bit is
 always a space (0) and tells the computer that new serial data is
 available. Data can be sent or received at any time, thus the name
 asynchronous.
<!-- NEED 1in -->
</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Figure 1 - Asynchronous Data Transmission
<BR> <IMG HEIGHT="16%" SRC="async.gif" WIDTH="50%"></P>
<P>The optional parity bit is a simple sum of the data bits indicating
 whether or not the data contains an even or odd number of 1 bits. With<I>
 even parity</I>, the parity bit is 0 if there is an even number of 1's
 in the character. With<I> odd parity</I>, the parity bit is 0 if there
 is an odd number of 1's in the data. You may also hear the terms<I>
 space parity</I>,<I> mark parity</I>, and<I> no parity</I>. Space
 parity means that the parity bit is always 0, while mark parity means
 the bit is always 1. No parity means that no parity bit is present or
 transmitted.</P>
<P>The remaining bits are called stop bits. There can be 1, 1.5, or 2
 stop bits between characters and they always have a value of 1. Stop
 bits traditionally were used to give the computer time to process the
 previous character, but now only serve to synchronize the receiving
 computer to the incoming characters.</P>
<P>Asynchronous data formats are usually expressed as &quot;8N1&quot;, &quot;7E1&quot;, and
 so forth. These stand for &quot;8 data bits, no parity, 1 stop bit&quot; and &quot;7
 data bits, even parity, 1 stop bit&quot; respectively.</P>
<H3><A NAME="2_3_1">What Are Full Duplex and Half Duplex?</A></H3>
<P><I>Full duplex</I> means that the computer can send and receive data
 simultaneously - there are two separate data channels (one coming in,
 one going out).</P>
<P><I>Half duplex</I> means that the computer cannot send or receive
 data at the same time. Usually this means there is only a single data
 channel to talk over. This does not mean that any of the RS-232 signals
 are not used. Rather, it usually means that the communications link
 uses some standard other than RS-232 that does not support full duplex
 operation.</P>
<H3><A NAME="2_3_2">Flow Control</A></H3>
<P>It is often necessary to regulate the flow of data when transferring
 data between two serial interfaces. This can be due to limitations in
 an intermediate serial communications link, one of the serial
 interfaces, or some storage media. Two methods are commonly used for
 asynchronous data.</P>
<P>The first method is often called &quot;software&quot; flow control and uses
 special characters to start (XON or DC1, 021 octal) or stop (XOFF or
 DC3, 023 octal) the flow of data. These characters are defined in the <A
HREF="#ascii">American Standard Code for Information Interchange
 (&quot;ASCII&quot;)</A>. While these codes are useful when transferring textual
 information, they cannot be used when transferring other types of
 information without special programming.</P>
<P>The second method is called &quot;hardware&quot; flow control and uses the
 RS-232 CTS and RTS signals instead of special characters. The receiver
 sets CTS to the space voltage when it is ready to receive more data and
 to the mark voltage when it is not ready. Likewise, the sender sets RTS
 to the space voltage when it is ready to send more data. Because
 hardware flow control uses a separate set of signals, it is much faster
 than software flow control which needs to send or receive multiple bits
 of information to do the same thing. CTS/RTS flow control is not
 supported by all hardware or operating systems.</P>
<H3><A NAME="2_3_3">What Is a Break?</A></H3>
<P>Normally a receive or transmit data signal stays at the mark voltage
 until a new character is transferred. If the signal is dropped to the
 space voltage for a long period of time, usually 1/4 to 1/2 second,
 then a break condition is said to exist.</P>
<P>A break is sometimes used to reset a communications line or change
 the operating mode of communications hardware like a MODEM. <A HREF="#modem">
Chapter 3, Talking to MODEMs</A> covers these applications in more
 depth.</P>
<H2><A NAME="2_4">Synchronous Communications</A></H2>
<P>Unlike asynchronous data, synchronous data appears as a constant
 stream of bits. To read the data on the line, the computer must provide
 or receive a common bit clock so that both the sender and receiver are
 synchronized.</P>
<P>Even with this synchronization, the computer must mark the beginning
 of the data somehow. The most common way of doing this is to use a data
 packet protocol like Serial Data Link Control (&quot;SDLC&quot;) or High-Speed
 Data Link Control (&quot;HDLC&quot;).</P>
<P>Each protocol defines certain bit sequences to represent the
 beginning and end of a data packet. Each also defines a bit sequence
 that is used when there is no data. These bit sequences allow the
 computer to see the beginning of a data packet.</P>
<P>Because synchronous protocols do not use per-character
 synchronization bits they typically provide at least a 25% improvement
 in performance over asynchronous communications and are suitable for
 remote networking and configurations with more than two serial
 interfaces.</P>
<P>Despite the speed advantages of synchronous communications, most
 RS-232 hardware does not support it due to the extra hardware and
 software required.</P>
<H2><A NAME="2_5">Accessing Serial Ports</A></H2>
<P>Like all devices, UNIX provides access to serial ports via<I> device
 files</I>. To access a serial port you simply open the corresponding
 device file.</P>
<H3><A NAME="2_5_1">Serial Port Files</A></H3>
<P>Each serial port on a UNIX system has one or more device files (files
 in the <TT>/dev</TT> directory) associated with it:
<CENTER>
<TABLE BORDER="1"><CAPTION ALIGN="CENTER"> Table 2 - Serial Port Device
 Files</CAPTION>

</TABLE>
</CENTER>
</P>
<H3><A NAME="2_5_2">Opening a Serial Port</A></H3>
<P>Since a serial port is a file, the<I> open(2)</I> function is used to
 access it. The one hitch with UNIX is that device files are usually not
 accessable by normal users. Workarounds include changing the access
 permissions to the file(s) in question, running your program as the
 super-user (root), or making your program set-userid so that it runs as
 the owner of the device file (not recommended for obvious security
 reasons...)</P>
<P>For now we'll assume that the file is accessable by all users. The
 code to open serial port 1 on a PC running Linux is show in <A HREF="#listing1">
Listing 1</A>.</P>
<P><A NAME="listing1"><I>Listing 1 - Opening a serial port.</I></A></P>
<PRE>
    #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;   /* Standard input/output definitions */
    #include &lt;string.h&gt;  /* String function definitions */

    /*

     *

     */

    int
    open_port(void)
    {
      int fd; /* File descriptor for the port */


      fd = open(&quot;/dev/ttyS0&quot;, O_RDWR | O_NOCTTY | O_NDELAY);
      if (fd == -1)
      {
       /*
	* Could not open the port.
	*/

	perror(&quot;open_port: Unable to open /dev/ttyS0 - &quot;);
      }
      else
	fcntl(fd, F_SETFL, 0);

      return (fd);
    }
</PRE>
<P>Other systems would require the corresponding device file name, but
 otherwise the code is the same.</P>
<H4>Open Options</H4>
<P>You'll notice that when we opened the device file we used two other
 flags along with the read+write mode:</P>
<PRE>
    fd = open(&quot;/dev/ttyS0&quot;, O_RDWR | O_NOCTTY | O_NDELAY);
</PRE>
<P>The<I> O_NOCTTY</I> flag tells UNIX that this program doesn't want to
 be the &quot;controlling terminal&quot; for that port. If you don't specify this
 then any input (such as keyboard abort signals and so forth) will
 affect your process. Programs like<I> getty(1M/8)</I> use this feature
 when starting the login process, but normally a user program does not
 want this behavior.</P>
<P>The<I> O_NDELAY</I> flag tells UNIX that this program doesn't care
 what state the DCD signal line is in - whether the other end of the
 port is up and running. If you do not specify this flag, your process
 will be put to sleep until the DCD signal line is the space voltage.</P>
<H3><A NAME="2_5_3">Writing Data to the Port</A></H3>
<P>Writing data to the port is easy - just use the<I> write(2)</I>
 system call to send data it:</P>
<PRE>
    n = write(fd, &quot;ATZ\r&quot;, 4);
    if (n &lt; 0)
      fputs(&quot;write() of 4 bytes failed!\n&quot;, stderr);
</PRE>
<P>The<I> write</I> function returns the number of bytes sent or -1 if
 an error occurred. Usually the only error you'll run into is<I> EIO</I>
 when a MODEM or data link drops the Data Carrier Detect (DCD) line.
 This condition will persist until you close the port.</P>
<H3><A NAME="2_5_4">Reading Data from the Port</A></H3>
<P>Reading data from a port is a little trickier. When you operate the
 port in raw data mode, each<I> read(2)</I> system call will return the
 number of characters that are actually available in the serial input
 buffers. If no characters are available, the call will block (wait)
 until characters come in, an interval timer expires, or an error
 occurs. The<I> read</I> function can be made to return immediately by
 doing the following:</P>
<PRE>

<P>The<I> c_cflag</I> member contains two options that should always be
 enabled,<I> CLOCAL</I> and<I> CREAD</I>. These will ensure that your
 program does not become the 'owner' of the port subject to sporatic job
 control and hangup signals, and also that the serial interface driver
 will read incoming data bytes.</P>
<P>The baud rate constants (<I>CBAUD</I>,<I> B9600</I>, etc.) are used
 for older interfaces that lack the<I> c_ispeed</I> and<I> c_ospeed</I>
 members. See the next section for information on the POSIX functions
 used to set the baud rate.</P>
<P><B>Never</B> initialize the<I> c_cflag</I> (or any other flag) member
 directly; you should always use the bitwise AND, OR, and NOT operators
 to set or clear bits in the members. Different operating system
 versions (and even patches) can and do use the bits differently, so
 using the bitwise operators will prevent you from clobbering a bit flag
 that is needed in a newer serial driver.</P>
<H4>Setting the Baud Rate</H4>
<P>The baud rate is stored in different places depending on the
 operating system. Older interfaces store the baud rate in the<I>
 c_cflag</I> member using one of the baud rate constants in table 4,
 while newer implementations provide the<I> c_ispeed</I> and<I> c_ospeed</I>
 members that contain the actual baud rate value.</P>
<P>The<I> cfsetospeed(3)</I> and<I> cfsetispeed(3)</I> functions are
 provided to set the baud rate in the<I> termios</I> structure
 regardless of the underlying operating system interface. Typically
 you'd use the code in <A HREF="#listing2">Listing 2</A> to set the baud
 rate.</P>

 constant specifies that all changes should occur immediately without
 waiting for output data to finish sending or input data to finish
 receiving. There are other constants to wait for input and output to
 finish or to flush the input and output buffers.</P>
<P>Most systems do not support different input and output speeds, so be
 sure to set both to the same value for maximum portability.

<H4>Choosing Canonical Input</H4>

 (carriage return) or LF (line feed) character is received.</P>
<P>When selecting this mode you normally select the<I> ICANON</I>,<I>
 ECHO</I>, and<I> ECHOE</I> options:</P>
<PRE>
    options.c_lflag |= (ICANON | ECHO | ECHOE);
</PRE>
<H4>Choosing Raw Input</H4>
<P>Raw input is unprocessed. Input characters are passed through exactly
 as they are received, when they are received. Generally you'll deselect
 the<I> ICANON</I>,<I> ECHO</I>,<I> ECHOE</I>, and<I> ISIG</I> options

<H4>Setting Input Parity Options</H4>
<P>You should enable input parity checking when you have enabled parity
 in the<I> c_cflag</I> member (<I>PARENB</I>). The revelant constants
 for input parity checking are<I> INPCK</I>,<I> IGNPAR</I>,<I> PARMRK</I>
, and<I> ISTRIP</I>. Generally you will select<I> INPCK</I> and<I>
 ISTRIP</I> to enable checking and stripping of the parity bit:</P>
<PRE>
    options.c_iflag |= (INPCK | ISTRIP);
</PRE>
<P><I>IGNPAR</I> is a somewhat dangerous option that tells the serial
 driver to ignore parity errors and pass the incoming data through as if
 no errors had occurred. This can be useful for testing the quality of a
 communications link, but in general is not used for practical reasons.</P>
<P><I>PARMRK</I> causes parity errors to be 'marked' in the input stream
 using special characters. If<I> IGNPAR</I> is enabled, a NUL character
 (000 octal) is sent to your program before every character with a
 parity error. Otherwise, a DEL (177 octal) and NUL character is sent
 along with the bad character.</P>
<H4>Setting Software Flow Control</H4>
<P>Software flow control is enabled using the<I> IXON</I>,<I> IXOFF</I>,
 and<I> IXANY</I> constants:</P>
<PRE>
    options.c_iflag |= (IXON | IXOFF | IXANY);
</PRE>
<P>To disable software flow control simply mask those bits:</P>
<PRE>
    options.c_iflag &amp;= ~(IXON | IXOFF | IXANY);

<H4>Setting Software Flow Control Characters</H4>
<P>The<I> VSTART</I> and<I> VSTOP</I> elements of the<I> c_cc</I> array
 contain the characters used for software flow control. Normally they
 should be set to DC1 (021 octal) and DC3 (023 octal) which represent
 the <A HREF="#ascii">ASCII</A> standard XON and XOFF characters.</P>
<H4>Setting Read Timeouts</H4>
<P>UNIX serial interface drivers provide the ability to specify
 character and packet timeouts. Two elements of the<I> c_cc</I> array
 are used for timeouts:<I> VMIN</I> and<I> VTIME</I>.<B> Timeouts are
 ignored in canonical input mode or when the<I> NDELAY</I> option is set
 on the file via<I> open</I> or<I> fcntl</I>.</B></P>
<P><I>VMIN</I> specifies the minimum number of characters to read. If it
 is set to 0, then the<I> VTIME</I> value specifies the time to wait for
 every character read. Note that this does not mean that a<I> read</I>
 call for N bytes will wait for N characters to come in. Rather, the
 timeout will apply to the first character and the<I> read</I> call will
 return the number of characters immediately available (up to the number
 you request).</P>
<P>If<I> VMIN</I> is non-zero,<I> VTIME</I> specifies the time to wait
 for the first character read. If a character is read within the time
 given, any read will block (wait) until all<I> VMIN</I> characters are
 read. That is, once the first character is read, the serial interface
 driver expects to receive an entire packet of characters (<I>VMIN</I>
 bytes total). If no character is read within the time allowed, then the
 call to<I> read</I> returns 0. This method allows you to tell the
 serial driver you need exactly N bytes and any<I> read</I> call will
 return 0 or N bytes. However, the timeout only applies to the first
 character read, so if for some reason the driver misses one character
 inside the N byte packet then the<I> read</I> call could block forever
 waiting for additional input characters.</P>
<P><I>VTIME</I> specifies the amount of time to wait for incoming
 characters in tenths of seconds. If<I> VTIME</I> is set to 0 (the
 default), reads will block (wait) indefinitely unless the<I> NDELAY</I>
 option is set on the port with<I> open</I> or<I> fcntl</I>.</P>

 speed and complexity of the conversion these tones sound more like loud
 screeching if you listen to them.</P>
<P>Telephone MODEMs are available today that can transfer data across a
 telephone line at nearly 53,000 bits per second, or 53kbps. In
 addition, most MODEMs use data compression technology that can increase
 the bit rate to well over 100kbps on some types of data.</P>
<H2><A NAME="4_2">Communicating With a MODEM</A></H2>
<P>The first step in communicating with a MODEM is to open and configure
 the port for<I> raw</I> input as shown in <A HREF="#listing3">Listing 3</A>
.
<!-- NEED 5in -->

<PRE>
    int            fd;

    /* open the port */
    fd = open(&quot;/dev/ttyS0&quot;, O_RDWR | O_NOCTTY | O_NDELAY);
    fcntl(fd, F_SETFL, 0);

    /* get the current options */

</PRE>
<P>Next you need to establish communications with the MODEM. The best
 way to do this is by sending the &quot;AT&quot; command to the MODEM. This also
 allows smart MODEMs to detect the baud you are using. When the MODEM is
 connected correctly and powered on it will respond with the response
 &quot;OK&quot;.</P>

<H3><A NAME="4_2_1">Standard MODEM Commands</A></H3>
<P>Most MODEMs support the &quot;AT&quot; command set, so called because each
 command starts with the &quot;AT&quot; characters. Each command is sent with the
 &quot;AT&quot; characters starting in the first column followed by the specific
 command and a carriage return (CR, 015 octal). After processing the
 command the MODEM will reply with one of several textual messages
 depending on the command.</P>
<H4>ATD - Dial A Number</H4>
<P>The<I> ATD</I> command dials the specified number. In addition to
 numbers and dashes you can specify tone (&quot;T&quot;) or pulse (&quot;P&quot;) dialing,
 pause for one second (&quot;,&quot;), and wait for a dialtone (&quot;W&quot;):</P>
<PRE>
    ATDT 555-1212
    ATDT 18008008008W1234,1,1234
    ATD T555-1212WP1234
</PRE>
<P>The MODEM will reply with one of the following messages:</P>
<PRE>
    NO DIALTONE
    BUSY
    NO CARRIER
    CONNECT
    CONNECT <I>baud</I>
</PRE>
<H4>ATH - Hang Up</H4>
<P>The<I> ATH</I> command causes the MODEM to hang up. Since the MODEM
 must be in &quot;command&quot; mode you probably won't use it during a normal
 phone call.</P>
<P>Most MODEMs will also hang up if DTR is dropped; you can do this by
 setting the baud to 0 for at least 1 second. Dropping DTR also returns
 the MODEM to command mode.</P>
<P>After a successful hang up the MODEM will reply with &quot;NO CARRIER&quot;. If
 the MODEM is still connected the &quot;CONNECT&quot; or &quot;CONNECT baud&quot; message
 will be sent.</P>
<H4>ATZ - Reset MODEM</H4>
 The<I> ATZ</I> command resets the MODEM. The MODEM will reply with the
 string &quot;OK&quot;.
<H3><A NAME="4_2_2">Common MODEM Communication Problems</A></H3>
<P>First and foremost,<I> don't forget to disable input echoing</I>.
 Input echoing will cause a feedback loop between the MODEM and
 computer.</P>
<P>Second, when sending MODEM commands you must terminate them with a
 carriage return (CR) and not a newline (NL). The C character constant
 for CR is &quot;\r&quot;.</P>
<P>Finally, when dealing with a MODEM make sure you use a baud that the
 MODEM supports. While many MODEMs do auto-baud detection, some have
 limits (19.2kbps is common on older MODEMs) that you must observe.</P>

<H2><A NAME="5_2">Selecting Input from a Serial Port</A></H2>
<P>While simple applications can poll or wait on data coming from the
 serial port, most applications are not simple and need to handle input
 from multiple sources.</P>
<P>UNIX provides this capability through the<I> select(2)</I> system
 call. This system call allows your program to check for input, output,
 or error conditions on one or more file descriptors. The file
 descriptors can point to serial ports, regular files, other devices,
 pipes, or sockets. You can poll to check for pending input, wait for
 input indefinitely, or timeout after a specific amount of time, making
 the<I> select</I> system call extremely flexible.</P>
<P>Most GUI Toolkits provide an interface to<I> select</I>; we will
 discuss the X Intrinsics (&quot;Xt&quot;) library later in this chapter.</P>
<H3><A NAME="5_2_1">The SELECT System Call</A></H3>
<P>The<I> select</I> system call accepts 5 arguments:</P>
<PRE>
    int select(int max_fd, fd_set *input, fd_set *output, fd_set *error,
               struct timeval *timeout);
</PRE>
<P>The<I> max_fd</I> argument specifies the highest numbered file
 descriptor in the<I> input</I>,<I> output</I>, and<I> error</I> sets.
 The<I> input</I>,<I> output</I>, and<I> error</I> arguments specify
 sets of file descriptors for pending input, output, or error
 conditions; specify <CODE>NULL</CODE> to disable monitoring for the
 corresponding condition. These sets are initialized using three macros:</P>
<PRE>
    FD_ZERO(&amp;fd_set);
    FD_SET(fd, &amp;fd_set);
    FD_CLR(fd, &amp;fd_set);
</PRE>
<P>The<I> FD_ZERO</I> macro clears the set entirely. The<I> FD_SET</I>
 and<I> FD_CLR</I> macros add and remove a file descriptor from the set,
 respectively.</P>
<P>The<I> timeout</I> argument specifies a timeout value which consists
 of seconds (<I>timeout.tv_sec</I>) and microseconds (<I>timeout.tv_usec</I>
). To poll one or more file descriptors, set the seconds and
 microseconds to zero. To wait indefinitely specify <CODE>NULL</CODE>
 for the timeout pointer.</P>
<P>The<I> select</I> system call returns the number of file descriptors
 that have a pending condition, or -1 if there was an error.</P>
<H3><A NAME="5_2_2">Using the SELECT System Call</A></H3>
<P>Suppose we are reading data from a serial port and a socket. We want
 to check for input from either file descriptor, but want to notify the
 user if no data is seen within 10 seconds. To do this we'll need to use
 the<I> select</I> system call, as shown in <A HREF="#listing8">Listing
 8</A>.

      if (FD_ISSET(sock, &amp;input))
	process_socket();
    }
</PRE>
<P>You'll notice that we first check the return value of the<I> select</I>
 system call. Values of 0 and -1 yield the appropriate warning and error
 messages. Values greater than 0 mean that we have data pending on one
 or more file descriptors.</P>
<P>To determine which file descriptor(s) have pending input, we use the<I>
 FD_ISSET</I> macro to test the input set for each file descriptor. If
 the file descriptor flag is set then the condition exists (input
 pending in this case) and we need to do something.</P>
<H3><A NAME="5_2_3">Using SELECT with the X Intrinsics Library</A></H3>
<P>The X Intrinsics library provides an interface to the<I> select</I>
 system call via the<I> XtAppAddInput(3x)</I> and<I>
 XtAppRemoveInput(3x)</I> functions:</P>
<PRE>
int XtAppAddInput(XtAppContext context, int fd, int mask,
                  XtInputProc proc, XtPointer data);
void XtAppRemoveInput(XtAppContext context, int input);
</PRE>
<P>The<I> select</I> system call is used internally to implement
 timeouts, work procedures, and check for input from the X server. These
 functions can be used with any Xt-based toolkit including Xaw, Lesstif,
 and Motif.</P>
<P>The<I> proc</I> argument to<I> XtAppAddInput</I> specifies the
 function to call when the selected condition (e.g. input available)
 exists on the file descriptor. In the previous example you could
 specify the<I> process_fd</I> or<I> process_socket</I> functions.</P>
<P>Because Xt limits your access to the<I> select</I> system call,
 you'll need to implement timeouts through another mechanism, probably
 via<I> XtAppAddTimeout(3x)</I>.</P>

 License</A></H1>
<P> Version 1.2, November 2002</P>
<P></P>
<PRE>
Copyright (C) 2000,2001,2002  Free Software Foundation, Inc.
59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
</PRE>
<P><STRONG> 0. PREAMBLE</STRONG></P>
<P> The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
 functional and useful document &quot;free&quot; in the sense of freedom: to
 assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it, with
 or without modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially.
 Secondarily, this License preserves for the author and publisher a way
 to get credit for their work, while not being considered responsible
 for modifications made by others.</P>
<P> This License is a kind of &quot;copyleft&quot;, which means that derivative
 works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense. It
 complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft license
 designed for free software.</P>
<P> We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for
 free software, because free software needs free documentation: a free
 program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the
 software does. But this License is not limited to software manuals; it
 can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or
 whether it is published as a printed book. We recommend this License
 principally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference.</P>
<P><STRONG> 1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS</STRONG></P>
<P> This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium,
 that contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be
 distributed under the terms of this License. Such a notice grants a
 world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration, to use that
 work under the conditions stated herein. The &quot;Document&quot;, below, refers
 to any such manual or work. Any member of the public is a licensee, and
 is addressed as &quot;you&quot;. You accept the license if you copy, modify or
 distribute the work in a way requiring permission under copyright law.</P>
<P> A &quot;Modified Version&quot; of the Document means any work containing the
 Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
 modifications and/or translated into another language.</P>
<P> A &quot;Secondary Section&quot; is a named appendix or a front-matter section
 of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the
 publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall subject
 (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall directly
 within that overall subject. (Thus, if the Document is in part a
 textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain any
 mathematics.) The relationship could be a matter of historical
 connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal,
 commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding
 them.</P>
<P> The &quot;Invariant Sections&quot; are certain Secondary Sections whose titles
 are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice
 that says that the Document is released under this License. If a
 section does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it is not
 allowed to be designated as Invariant. The Document may contain zero
 Invariant Sections. If the Document does not identify any Invariant
 Sections then there are none.</P>
<P> The &quot;Cover Texts&quot; are certain short passages of text that are
 listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that
 says that the Document is released under this License. A Front-Cover
 Text may be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25
 words.</P>
<P> A &quot;Transparent&quot; copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
 represented in a format whose specification is available to the general
 public, that is suitable for revising the document straightforwardly
 with generic text editors or (for images composed of pixels) generic
 paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available drawing editor,
 and that is suitable for input to text formatters or for automatic
 translation to a variety of formats suitable for input to text
 formatters. A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file format whose
 markup, or absence of markup, has been arranged to thwart or discourage
 subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent. An image format
 is not Transparent if used for any substantial amount of text. A copy
 that is not &quot;Transparent&quot; is called &quot;Opaque&quot;.</P>
<P> Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
 ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML or
 XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple
 HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for human modification. Examples of
 transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG. Opaque formats
 include proprietary formats that can be read and edited only by
 proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD and/or
 processing tools are not generally available, and the machine-generated
 HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by some word processors for output
 purposes only.</P>
<P> The &quot;Title Page&quot; means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
 plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material
 this License requires to appear in the title page. For works in formats
 which do not have any title page as such, &quot;Title Page&quot; means the text
 near the most prominent appearance of the work's title, preceding the
 beginning of the body of the text.</P>
<P> A section &quot;Entitled XYZ&quot; means a named subunit of the Document whose
 title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses following
 text that translates XYZ in another language. (Here XYZ stands for a
 specific section name mentioned below, such as &quot;Acknowledgements&quot;,
 &quot;Dedications&quot;, &quot;Endorsements&quot;, or &quot;History&quot;.) To &quot;Preserve the Title&quot;
 of such a section when you modify the Document means that it remains a
 section &quot;Entitled XYZ&quot; according to this definition.</P>
<P> The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice
 which states that this License applies to the Document. These Warranty
 Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in this License,
 but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other implication that
 these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and has no effect on the
 meaning of this License.</P>
<P><STRONG> 2. VERBATIM COPYING</STRONG></P>
<P> You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
 commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
 copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies
 to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other
 conditions whatsoever to those of this License. You may not use
 technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further
 copying of the copies you make or distribute. However, you may accept
 compensation in exchange for copies. If you distribute a large enough
 number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.</P>
<P> You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above,
 and you may publicly display copies.</P>
<P><STRONG> 3. COPYING IN QUANTITY</STRONG></P>
<P> If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly have
 printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and the
 Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the
 copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover
 Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on
 the back cover. Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify you
 as the publisher of these copies. The front cover must present the full
 title with all words of the title equally prominent and visible. You
 may add other material on the covers in addition. Copying with changes
 limited to the covers, as long as they preserve the title of the
 Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated as verbatim
 copying in other respects.</P>
<P> If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
 legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
 reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent
 pages.</P>
<P> If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering
 more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent
 copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy
 a computer-network location from which the general network-using public
 has access to download using public-standard network protocols a
 complete Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material. If
 you use the latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when
 you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that
 this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated
 location until at least one year after the last time you distribute an
 Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that
 edition to the public.</P>
<P> It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of
 the Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to
 give them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the
 Document.</P>
<P><STRONG> 4. MODIFICATIONS</STRONG></P>
<P> You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under
 the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release the
 Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified
 Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution
 and modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy of
 it. In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version:</P>
<P></P>
<UL>
<LI><STRONG>A.</STRONG> Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if
 any) a title distinct from that of the Document, and from those of
 previous versions (which should, if there were any, be listed in the
 History section of the Document). You may use the same title as a
 previous version if the original publisher of that version gives
 permission.</LI>
<LI><STRONG>B.</STRONG> List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more
 persons or entities responsible for authorship of the modifications in
 the Modified Version, together with at least five of the principal
 authors of the Document (all of its principal authors, if it has fewer
 than five), unless they release you from this requirement.</LI>
<LI><STRONG>C.</STRONG> State on the Title page the name of the
 publisher of the Modified Version, as the publisher.</LI>
<LI><STRONG>D.</STRONG> Preserve all the copyright notices of the
 Document.</LI>
<LI><STRONG>E.</STRONG> Add an appropriate copyright notice for your
 modifications adjacent to the other copyright notices.</LI>
<LI><STRONG>F.</STRONG> Include, immediately after the copyright
 notices, a license notice giving the public permission to use the
 Modified Version under the terms of this License, in the form shown in
 the Addendum below.</LI>
<LI><STRONG>G.</STRONG> Preserve in that license notice the full lists
 of Invariant Sections and required Cover Texts given in the Document's
 license notice.</LI>
<LI><STRONG>H.</STRONG> Include an unaltered copy of this License.</LI>
<LI><STRONG>I.</STRONG> Preserve the section Entitled &quot;History&quot;,
 Preserve its Title, and add to it an item stating at least the title,
 year, new authors, and publisher of the Modified Version as given on
 the Title Page. If there is no section Entitled &quot;History&quot; in the
 Document, create one stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of
 the Document as given on its Title Page, then add an item describing
 the Modified Version as stated in the previous sentence.</LI>
<LI><STRONG>J.</STRONG> Preserve the network location, if any, given in
 the Document for public access to a Transparent copy of the Document,
 and likewise the network locations given in the Document for previous
 versions it was based on. These may be placed in the &quot;History&quot; section.
 You may omit a network location for a work that was published at least
 four years before the Document itself, or if the original publisher of
 the version it refers to gives permission.</LI>
<LI><STRONG>K.</STRONG> For any section Entitled &quot;Acknowledgements&quot; or
 &quot;Dedications&quot;, Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the
 section all the substance and tone of each of the contributor
 acknowledgements and/or dedications given therein.</LI>
<LI><STRONG>L.</STRONG> Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the
 Document, unaltered in their text and in their titles. Section numbers
 or the equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.</LI>
<LI><STRONG>M.</STRONG> Delete any section Entitled &quot;Endorsements&quot;. Such
 a section may not be included in the Modified Version.</LI>
<LI><STRONG>N.</STRONG> Do not retitle any existing section to be
 Entitled &quot;Endorsements&quot; or to conflict in title with any Invariant
 Section.</LI>
<LI><STRONG>O.</STRONG> Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.</LI>
</UL>
<P> If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
 appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material
 copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all
 of these sections as invariant. To do this, add their titles to the
 list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version's license notice.
 These titles must be distinct from any other section titles.</P>
<P> You may add a section Entitled &quot;Endorsements&quot;, provided it contains
 nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
 parties--for example, statements of peer review or that the text has
 been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a
 standard.</P>
<P> You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and
 a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the
 list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version. Only one passage of
 Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or through
 arrangements made by) any one entity. If the Document already includes
 a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or by
 arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of, you
 may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit
 permission from the previous publisher that added the old one.</P>
<P> The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this
 License give permission to use their names for publicity for or to
 assert or imply endorsement of any Modified Version.</P>
<P><STRONG> 5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS</STRONG></P>
<P> You may combine the Document with other documents released under
 this License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified
 versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the
 Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and
 list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its
 license notice, and that you preserve all their Warranty Disclaimers.</P>
<P> The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
 multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
 copy. If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but
 different contents, make the title of each such section unique by
 adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original
 author or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number.
 Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of Invariant
 Sections in the license notice of the combined work.</P>
<P> In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled &quot;History&quot;
 in the various original documents, forming one section Entitled
 &quot;History&quot;; likewise combine any sections Entitled &quot;Acknowledgements&quot;,
 and any sections Entitled &quot;Dedications&quot;. You must delete all sections
 Entitled &quot;Endorsements.&quot;</P>
<P><STRONG> 6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS</STRONG></P>
<P> You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other
 documents released under this License, and replace the individual
 copies of this License in the various documents with a single copy that
 is included in the collection, provided that you follow the rules of
 this License for verbatim copying of each of the documents in all other
 respects.</P>
<P> You may extract a single document from such a collection, and
 distribute it individually under this License, provided you insert a
 copy of this License into the extracted document, and follow this
 License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of that
 document.</P>
<P><STRONG> 7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS</STRONG></P>
<P> A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate
 and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or
 distribution medium, is called an &quot;aggregate&quot; if the copyright
 resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the legal rights of
 the compilation's users beyond what the individual works permit. When
 the Document is included in an aggregate, this License does not apply
 to the other works in the aggregate which are not themselves derivative
 works of the Document.</P>
<P> If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
 copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half of
 the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed on
 covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the
 electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic form.
 Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket the whole
 aggregate.</P>
<P><STRONG> 8. TRANSLATION</STRONG></P>
<P> Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
 distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section 4.
 Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
 permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
 translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
 original versions of these Invariant Sections. You may include a
 translation of this License, and all the license notices in the
 Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also include
 the original English version of this License and the original versions
 of those notices and disclaimers. In case of a disagreement between the
 translation and the original version of this License or a notice or
 disclaimer, the original version will prevail.</P>
<P> If a section in the Document is Entitled &quot;Acknowledgements&quot;,
 &quot;Dedications&quot;, or &quot;History&quot;, the requirement (section 4) to Preserve
 its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the actual title.</P>
<P><STRONG> 9. TERMINATION</STRONG></P>
<P> You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document
 except as expressly provided for under this License. Any other attempt
 to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Document is void, and
 will automatically terminate your rights under this License. However,
 parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this
 License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties
 remain in full compliance.</P>
<P><STRONG> 10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE</STRONG></P>
<P> The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of
 the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time. Such new versions
 will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in
 detail to address new problems or concerns. See
 http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/.</P>
<P> Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version
 number. If the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of
 this License &quot;or any later version&quot; applies to it, you have the option
 of following the terms and conditions either of that specified version
 or of any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the
 Free Software Foundation. If the Document does not specify a version
 number of this License, you may choose any version ever published (not
 as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.</P>
<H2><A NAME="8_1">How to use this License for your documents</A></H2>
<P> To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy
 of the License in the document and put the following copyright and
 license notices just after the title page:</P>
<P></P>
<PRE>
      Copyright (c)  YEAR  YOUR NAME.
      Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document
      under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.2
      or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;
      with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover
	 Texts.  A copy of the license is included in the section entitled &quot;GNU
      Free Documentation License&quot;.
</PRE>
<P> If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover
 Texts, replace the &quot;with...Texts.&quot; line with this:</P>
<P></P>
<PRE>
    with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with the
    Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts being LIST.
</PRE>
<P> If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other
 combination of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the
 situation.</P>
<P> If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we
 recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of
 free software license, such as the GNU General Public License, to
 permit their use in free software.</P>
