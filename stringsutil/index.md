StringsUtil provides a library for using Apple ".strings" localization files and
a utility for managing those files.  It is intended as a free, smaller,
embeddable, and more flexible alternative to GNU gettext.  Key features include:

- Support for localizing using both Apple ".strings" and GNU gettext ".po"
  files.
- Simple C/C++ library with support for embedding localization data in an
  executable and/or loading localizations from external files.
- Tools for exporting, importing, and merging localization files.
- Tool for reporting on the quality of a localization.
- Tool for scanning C/C++ source files for localization strings.
- *Coming Soon*: Tool for doing a first pass machine translation.
